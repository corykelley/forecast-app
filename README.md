# Forecast

Forecast was made as 'one day challenge' of sorts. Months into my programming journey I had realized that I had never hit a Weather API, so I did some research, grabbed an API key and got to work.

This simple little weather app is bare bones and inspired by the simplicity that Apple's iPhone weather app has. Simple input a city and country and get back the name, temp, and a brief description of current conditions.

## Future Enhancements

I have ideas to implement a 'zip code' search in the future. The reason behind this is that most US users may find only one version of a city that is not really theirs. In fact, this is bound to happen... zip code search should help that.

## Tools

This app was made entirely in React and styled with SASS/CSS. I utilized React Icons for the weather condition icons.
